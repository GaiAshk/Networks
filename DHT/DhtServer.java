/** Server for simple distributed hash table that stores (key,value) strings.
 *  
 *  usage: DhtServer myIp numRoutes cfgFile [ cache ] [ debug ] [ predFile ]
 *  
 *  myIp	is the IP address to use for this server's socket
 *  numRoutes	is the max number of nodes allowed in the DHT's routing table;
 *  		typically lg(numNodes)
 *  cfgFile	is the name of a file in which the server writes the IP
 *		address and port number of its socket
 *  cache	is an optional argument; if present it is the literal string
 *		"cache"; when cache is present, the caching feature of the
 *		server is enabled; otherwise it is not
 *  debug	is an optional argument; if present it is the literal string
 *		"debug"; when debug is present, a copy of every packet received
 *		and sent is printed on stdout
 *  predFile	is an optional argument specifying the configuration file of
 *		this node's predecessor in the DHT; this file is used to obtain
 *		the IP address and port number of the predecessor's socket,
 *		allowing this node to join the DHT by contacting predecessor
 *  
 *  The DHT uses UDP packets containing ASCII text. Here's an example of the
 *  UDP payload for a get request from a client.
 *  
 *  CSE473 DHTPv0.1
 *  type:get
 *  key:dungeons
 *  tag:12345
 *  ttl:100
 *  
 *  The first line is just an identifying string that is required in every
 *  DHT packet. The remaining lines all start with a keyword and :, usually
 *  followed by some additional text. Here, the type field specifies that
 *  this is a get request; the key field specifies the key to be looked up;
 *  the tag is a client-specified tag that is returned in the response; and
 *  can be used by the client to match responses with requests; the ttl is
 *  decremented by every DhtServer and if <0, causes the packet to be discarded.
 *  
 *  Possible responses to the above request include:
 *  
 *  CSE473 DHTPv0.1
 *  type:success
 *  key:dungeons
 *  value:dragons
 *  tag:12345
 *  ttl:95
 *  
 *  or
 *  
 *  CSE473 DHTPv0.1
 *  type:no match
 *  key:dungeons
 *  tag:12345
 *  ttl:95
 *  
 *  Put requests are formatted similarly, but in this case the client typically
 *  specifies a value field (omitting the value field causes the pair with the
 *  specified key to be removed).
 *  
 *  The packet type "failure" is used to indicate an error of some sort; in
 *  this case, the "reason" field provides an explanation of the failure.
 *  The "join" type is used by a server to join an existing DHT. In the same
 *  way, the "leave" type is used by the leaving server to circle around the
 *  DHT asking other servers to delete it from their routing tables.  The 
 *  "transfer" type is used to transfer (key,value) pairs to a newly added
 *  server. The "update" type is used to update the predecessor, successor,
 *  or hash range of another DHT server, usually when a join or leave even 
 *  happens. 
 *
 *  Other fields and their use are described briefly below
 *  clientAdr 	is used to specify the IP address and port number of the 
 *              client that sent a particular request; it is added to a request
 *              packet by the first server to receive the request, before 
 *              forwarding the packet to another node in the DHT; an example of
 *              the format is clientAdr:123.45.67.89:51349.
 *  relayAdr  	is used to specify the IP address and port number of the first
 *              server to receive a request packet from the client; it is added
 *              to the packet by the first server before forwarding the packet.
 *  hashRange 	is a pair of integers separated by a colon, specifying a range
 *              of hash indices; it is included in the response to a "join"
 *              packet, to inform the new DHT server of the set of hash values
 *              it is responsible for; it is also included in the update packet
 *              to update the hash range a server is responsible for.
 *  succInfo  	is the IP address and port number of a server, followed by its
 *              first hash index; this information is included in the response
 *              to a join packet to inform the new DHT server about its 
 *              immediate successor; itâ€™s also included in the update packet 
 *              to change the immediate successor of a DHT server; an example 
 *              of the format is succInfo:123.45.6.7:5678:987654321.
 *  predInfo	is also the IP address and port number of a server, followed
 *              by its first hash index; this information is included in a join
 *              packet to inform the successor DHT server of its new 
 *              predecessor; it is also included in update packets to update 
 *              the new predecessor of a server.
 *  senderInfo	is the IP address and port number of a DHT server, followed by
 *              its first hash index; this information is sent by a DHT to 
 *              provide routing information that can be used by other servers.
 *              It also used in leave packet to let other servers know the IP
 *              address and port number information of the leaving server.
