/** Source/Sink class
 *  This class generates packet payloads and checks incoming
 *  payloads, sent by a peer host. Each outgoing payload takes
 *  the form of the string "testing 123" where the number is a
 *  sequence number that starts at 1 and is incremented for every
 *  payload sent. When payloads are received, we check the sequence
 *  number of the arriving payloads to make sure that we are getting
 *  the payloads in the proper sequence.
 *
 *  When a new payload is generated, it is passed to an Rdt object,
 *  using its send method. Similarly, packets are received from the
 *  Rdt object using its receive method.
 *
 *  The thread is started using the start method (which calls the
 *  run method in a new thread of control). It can be stopped
 *  using the stop method; this causes the run method to terminate
 *  its main loop and print a short status report, then return.
