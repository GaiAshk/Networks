/** Test reliable data transport protocol.
 *  usage: TestRdt myIp myPort wSize timeout [ debug ]
 *  		[ discProb delta runLength ] [ peerIp peerPort  ]
 *  
 *  A pair of TestRdt processes can be used to test the Rdt class.
 *  One is used as a server, the other as a client. The server should
 *  be started first. Both may send packets.
 *  
 *  myIp	is the IP address to be bound to this program's socket
 *  myPort	is the port number to be bound to this program's socket;
 *  		when starting a client, this can be set to zero
 *  wSize	is the window size to be used by the protocol (in packets);
 *	        should be the same at both ends
 *  timeout	is the time that the protocol waits before re-sending a packet
 *			(expressed as a floating point value in seconds)
 *  debug	if the debug argument is present and equal to the string
 *  		"debug", the program prints every packet sent or received
 *  discProb	is the probability that a generated packet gets discarded,
 *  		allowing us to exercise the protocol's ability to recover;
 *  		default value is 0
 *  delta	is the time to wait between sending packets at the source
 *  		(expressed as a floating point value in seconds);
 *  		if zero, no packets are sent; default is 0
 *  runLength	is the duration of the run (expressed as a floating point value
 *  		n seconds); if it is zero, the process runs until it is killed;
 *  		default is zero
 *  peerIp	is the IP address of the peer host - only required for client
 *  peerPort	is the IP address of the peer host - only required for client
